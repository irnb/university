## 📅 About My Journey

I'm currently pursuing my **Bachelor's in Computer Science** at **Azad University**. Over the course of 3 years, I need to complete **140 units** to earn my degree. During this time, I'll be sharing my learnings, projects, and insights. 🚀

In this repository, you'll find:

- 🔹 Projects from various courses.
- 🔹 Notes and homework assignments (some in English, some in Persian).
- 🔹 Files and directories named using the **Jalaali calendar** 🗓️ for an added touch of localization!
